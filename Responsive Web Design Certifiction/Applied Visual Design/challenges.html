<!--Problem 1-->
<!--
    Create Visual Balance using the text-align property:
    CSS has several options for how to align web content with text using the text-align property.

    text-align: justify; causes all lines of text except the last line to meet the left and right edges of the line box.

    text-align: center; centers the text

    text-align: right; right-aligns the text

    text-align: left; (the default) left-aligns the text

    Align the h4 tag's text, which says "Google", to the center. Then justify the paragraph tag which contains information about how
    Google was founded.
-->
<style>
    h4 {
        text-align: center;
    }

    p {
        text-align: justify;
    }

    .links {
        margin-right: 20px;
    }

    .fullCard {
        border: 1px solid #ccc;
        border-radius: 5px;
        margin: 10px 5px;
        padding: 4px;
    }

    .cardContent {
        padding: 10px;
    }
</style>

<div class='fullCard'>
    <div class='cardContent'>
        <div class='cardText'>
            <h4>Google</h4>

<!--Problem 2-->
<!--
    Adjust the Width of an element using the width property:
    You can specify the width of an element using the width property in CSS. Values can be given in relative length units (such as em), 
    absolute length units (such as px), or as a percentage of its containing parent element. Here's an example that changes the width of
    an image to 220px:

    img {
        width: 220px;
    }

    Add a width property to the entire card and set it to an absolute value of 245px. Use the fullCard class to select the element.
-->
<style>
    .fullCard {
        width: 245px;
        border: 1px solid #ccc;
        border-radius: 5px;
        margin: 10px 5px;
        padding: 4px;
    }
</style>

<!--Problem 3-->
<!--
    Adjust the height of an element using the height property:
    You can specify the height of an element using the height property in CSS, similar to the width property. Here's an example that changes
    the height of an image to 20px:

    img {
        height: 20px;
    }

    Add a height property to the h4 tag and set it to 25px.
-->
<style>
    h4 {
        text-align: center;
        height: 25px;
    }
</style>

<!--problem 4-->
<!--
    Use the strong tag to make text bold:
    To make text bold, you can use the strong tag. This is often used to draw attention to text and symbolize that it is important.
    With the strong tag, the browser applies the CSS of font-weight: bold; to the element.

    Wrap a strong tag around "Standford University" inside the p tag (do not include the period).
-->
<strong>Stanford University</strong>

<!--Problem 5-->
<!--
    Use the u tag to underline text:
    To underline text, you can use the u tag. This is often used to signify that a section of text is important, or something to remember.
    With the u tag, the browser applies the CSS of text-decoration: underline; to the element.

    Wrap the u tag only aroun the text "Ph.D studnets". 

    Note: try to avoid using the u tag when it could be confused for a link. Anchor tags also have a default underlined formatting.
-->
<u>Ph.d students</u>

<!--Problem 6-->
<!--
   Use the em tag to italicize text:
   To emphasize text, you can use the em tag. This displays text as italicized, as the browser applies the CSS of font-style: italic;
   to the element.

   Wrap an em tag around the contents of the paragraph tag to give it emphasis.
-->

<p><em>Google was founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were <u>Ph.D students</u> at <strong>Stanford University</strong>.</em></p>

<!--Problem 7-->
<!--
    Use the s tag to strikethrough text:
    To strikethrough text, which is when a horizontal line cuts across the characters, you can use the s tag. It shows that a section of text
    is no longer valid. With the s tag, the browser applies the CSS of text-decoration: line-through; to the element.

    Wrap the s tag around "Google" inside the h4 tag and then add the ord Alphabet beside it, which should not have the strikethrough formatting.
-->
<h4><s>Google</s>Alphabet</h4>

<!--Problem 8-->
<!--
    Create a Horizontal Line using the hr element:
    You can use the hr tag to add a horizontal line across the width of its containing element. This can be used to define a change in topic
    or to visually separate groups of content.

    Add an hr tag underneath the h4 which contains the card title.

    Note: in HTML, hr is a self-closing tag, and therefore doesn't need a separate closing tag.
-->
<h4><s>Google</s>Alphabet</h4>
<hr>

<!--Problem 9-->
<!--
    Adjust the background-color property of text:
    Instead of adjusting your overall background or the color of the text to make the foreground easily readable, you can add a background-color
    to the element holding the text you want to emphasize. This challenge uses rgba() instead of hex codes or normal rgb().

    rgba() stands for:
    r = red
    g = green
    b = blue
    a = alpha/level of opacity

    the RGB values can range from 0 to 255. The alpha value can range from 1, which is fully opaque or solid color, to 0, which is fully
    transparent or clear. rgba() is great to use in this case, as it allows you to adjust the opacity. This means you don't have to completely
    block out the background.

    You'll use background-color: rgba(45, 45, 45, 0.1); for this challenge. It produces a dark gray color that is nearly transparent given the
    low opacity value of 0.1.

    To make the text stand out more, adjust the background-color of the h4 element to the given rgba() value.

    Also for the h4, remove the height property and add padding of 10px.
-->
<style>
    h4 {
        background-color: rgba(45, 45, 45, 0.1);
        padding: 10px;
    }
</style>
<h4><s>Google</s>Alphabet</h4>

<!--Problem 10-->
<!--
    Adjust the Size of a header vs a paragraph tag:
    The font size of header tags (h1 through h6) should generally be larger than the font sizes of paragraph tags. This makes it easier for
    the user to visually understand the layout and level of importance of everything on the page. You use the font-size property to adjust 
    the size of the text in an element.

    To make the heading significantly larger than the paragraph, change the font-size of the h4 tag to 27px.
-->
<style>
    h4 {
        background-color: rgba(45, 45, 45, 0.1);
        padding: 10px;
        font-size: 27px;
    }
</style>
<h4><s>Google</s>Alphabet</h4>

<!--Problem 11-->
<!--
   Add a box-shadow to a card-like Element:
   The box-shadow property applies one or more shadows to an element.
   
   The box-shadow property takes values for:
   - offset-x (how far to push the shadow horizontally from the element)
   - offset-y (how far to push the shadow vertically from the element)
   - blur-radius
   - spread-radius
   - color

   The blur-radius and spread-radius values are optional.

   Multiple box-shadows can be created by using commas to separate properties of each box-shadow element. 

   Here's an eample of the CSS to create multiple shadows with some blur, at mostly- transparent black colors:

   box-shadow: 0 10px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0,19), 0 6px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0,23);

   The element now has an id of thumbnail. With this seletor, use the example CSS values above to place a box-shadow on the card.
-->
<style>
    #thumbnail {
        box-shadow: 0 10px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.19), 0 6px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.23);
    }
</style>

<div class='fullCard' id='thumbnail'></div>

<!--Problem 12-->
<!--
    Decrease the Opacity of an Element:
    The opacity property in CSS is used to adjust the opacity, or conversely, the transparency for an item.

    A avalue of 1 is opaque, which isn't transparent at all.
    A value of 0.5 is half see-through
    A value of 0 is completely transparent.

    The value given will apply to the entire element, whether that;s an image with some transparency, or the foreground and background colors
    for a block of text.

    Set the opacity of the anchor tags to 0.7 using links class to select them.
-->
<style>
    .links {
        text-align: left;
        color: black;
        opacity: 0.7;
    }

<!--
    Use the text-transform property to make text uppercase:
    The text-transform property in CSS is used to change the appearance of text. It's a convenient way to make sure text on a webpage appears
    consistently, without having to change the text content of the actual HTML elements.

    The following table shows how the different text-transform values change the example text "Transform me".

    lowercase = 'transform me'
    uppercase = 'TRANSFORM ME'
    capitalize = 'Transform Me'
    initial = Use the default value
    inherit = use the text-transform value from the parent element
    none = Default: Use the original text

    Transform the text of the h4 to be uppercase using the text-transform property
-->
<style>
    h4 {
        text-transform: uppercase;
        text-align: center;
        background-color: rgba(45, 45, 45, 0.1);
        paddding: 10px;
        font-size: 27px;
        text-transform: uppercase;
    }
</style>

    Set the font-size for Multiple Heading Elements:
    The font-size property is used to specify how large the text is in a given element. This rule can be used for multiple elements to
    create visual consistency of text on a page. In this challenge, you'll set the values for all h1 through h6 tags to balance the heading
    sizes.

    -set the font-size of the h1 tag to 68px.
    -set the font-size of the h2 tag to 52px.
    -set the font-size of the h3 tag to 40px.
    -set the font-size of the h4 tag to 32px.
    -set the font-size of the h5 tag to 21px.
    -set the font-size of the h6 tag to 14px.
-->
<style>
    h1 {
        font-size: 68px;

<!--
    Set the font-weight for Multiple Heading Elements:
    you set the font-size of each heading tag in the last challenge, here you'll adjust the font-weight.

    The font-weight property sets how thick or thin characters are in a section of text.

    -set the font-weight of the h1 tag to 800.
    -set the font-weight of the h2 tag to 600.
    -set the font-weight of the h3 tag to 500.
    -set the font-weight of the h4 tag to 400.
    -set the font-weight of the h5 tag to 300.
    -set the font-weight of the h6 tag to 200.

<!--
    Set the font-size of paragraph text:
    The font-size property in CSS is not limited to headings, it can be applied to any element containing text.

    Change the value of the font-size property for the paragraph to 16px to make it more visible.
-->
<style>
    p {
        font-size: 16px;
    }

<p>...</p>

<!--Problem 17-->
<!--
    Set the line-height of paragraphs:
    CSS offers the line-height property to change the height of each line in a block of text. As the name suggests, it changes the amount
    of vertical space that each line of text gets.

    Add a line-height property to the p tag and set it to 25px
-->
<style>
    p {
        font-size: 16px;
        line-height: 25px;

<!--Problem 18-->
<!--
    Adjust the hover state of an anchor tag:
    This challenge will touch on the usage of pseudo-classes. A pseudo-class is a keyword that can be added to selectors, in order to select
    a speciic state of the element.

    For example, the styling of an anchor tag can be changed for its hover state using the :hover pseudo-class selector. Here's the CSS
    to change the color of the anchor tag to red during its hover state:

    a:hover {
        color: red;
    }

    The code editor has a CSS rule to style all a tags black. Add a rule so that when the user hovers over the a tag, the color is blue.
-->
<style>
    a {
        color: #000;
    }

    a:hover {

<!--
    Change an Element's Relative Position:
    CSS treats each HTML element as its own box, which is usually referred to as the CSS Box Model. Block-level items automatically start on
    a new line (think headings, paragraphs, and divs) while inline items sit within surrounding content (like images or spans). The default
    layout of elements in this way is called the normal flow of a document, but CSS offers the position property to override it.

    When the position of an element is set to relative, it allows you to specify how CSS should move it relative to its current position in
    the normal flow of the page. It pairs with the CSS offset properties of left or right, and top or bottom. These say how many pixels,
    percentages, or ems to move the item away from where it is normally positioned. The following example moves the paragraph 10 pixels away 
    from the bottom:

    p {
        position: relative;
        bottom: 10px;
    }

    Changing an element's position to relative does not remove it from the normal flow -- other elements around it still behave as if that item were in its
    default position. Note: positioning give syou a lot of flexibility and power over the visual layout of a page. It's good to remember 
    that no matter the position of elements, the underlying HTML markup should be organized and make sense when rea from top to bottom. This
    is how users with visual impairments (who rely on assistive devices like screen readers access your content).

    Change the position of the h2 to relative, and use a CSS offset to move it 15 pixels away from the top of where it sits in the normal flow.
    Notice there is no impact on the positions of the surrounding h1 and p elements.
-->
<style>
    h2 {
        position: relative;
        top: 15px;
    }
</style>
<body>
    <h1>On being well-positioned</h1>
    <h2>move me!</h2>
    <p>I still think the h2 is where it normally sits.</p>
</body>
