    Introduction to Basic CSS
    Cascading style sheets (CSS) tell the browser how to display the text and
    other content that you write in HTML.

    CSS has been adopted by all major browsers and allows you to control:
    color, font, positioning, spacing, sizing, decorations, transitions

    There are three main ways to apply CSS styling. You can apply inline styles directly to HTML
    elements with the style attribute. Alternatively, you can place CSS rules within style tags
    in an HTML document. Finally, you can write CSS rules in an external style sheet, then reference
    that file in the HTML document. Even though the first two options have their use cases, most
    developers prefer external style sheets because they keep the styles separate from the HTML
    elements. This improves the readability and reuseability of your code. 

    The idea behind CSS is that you can use a selector to target an HTML element in the DOM
    (document object model) and then apply a variety of attributes to that element to change the
    way it is displayed on the page.
